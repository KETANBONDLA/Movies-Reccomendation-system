# üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

A simple **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** built with Python. It recommends movies based on textual similarity between their **overviews** and **genres**, using **CountVectorizer** and **Cosine Similarity**.

## ‚ú® Features

- Cleans and preprocesses movie data  
- Combines `Overview` and `Genre` into a single `Tags` field  
- Uses `CountVectorizer` to extract features from text  
- Computes pairwise similarity using **cosine similarity**  
- Recommends **Top 5** similar movies for a given movie title  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Loads the movie dataset from `movies1.csv`  
2. Removes rows with missing values and duplicates  
3. Merges `Overview` and `Genre` into a `Tags` column  
4. Converts text data into feature vectors using `CountVectorizer`  
5. Calculates similarity scores using cosine similarity  
6. Recommends the top 5 similar movies for a selected title

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```python
recommend("12 Angry Men")
```

**Output:**  
Top 5 movie recommendations similar to "12 Angry Men".
